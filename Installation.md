# Installation
Before trying to run any of the websites in this repository, make sure to have the following things installed:
- A code editor, preferably with a build-in terminal, like Visual Studio Code.
- An Apache server, like XAMPP.
- A way to import/export and edit a MySQL database, for example using MySQL Workbench.
- Node.js

Once all of the above installations are done, everything that is required to run the websites, minus Node.js packages, will have been installed.

Information on setting up each individual project can be found in its own folder.
